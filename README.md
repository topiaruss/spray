We're developing on Ubuntu 11.04, but OSX and other platforms
should be fine too, given a few tweaks.

Start by forking this repository, then clone it to your development
machine - something like this::

    $ git clone https://github.com/Sponsorcraft/spray.git

Issue the following commands::

    $ cd spray
    $ virtualenv .
